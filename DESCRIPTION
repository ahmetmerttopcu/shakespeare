Description: Tools in R to parse and analyse the XML
    versions of Shakespeare's plays from files created by Jon Bosak.
    The plays are parsed into Python objects.  Special classes represent structured
    components of the plays (Act, Scene, Speech), allowing analysis beyond simple
    textual tools.
