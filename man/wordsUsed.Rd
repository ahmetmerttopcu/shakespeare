\description{
[Python Documentation]
Given a list of tokens, returns a list of the distinct words included.
Words are converted to lower case for comparison.
Common words are excluded by default, being defined as the stopwords set from
NLTK supplemented with a few common words in Elizabethan English.
Punctuation is also excluded by default.  Optional second & third arguments in
the call can override if supplied as True.
}
\details{
The function can also be called with a dictionary whose elements are token lists,
as returned by the tokens() function. In this case, it calls iself recursively to in
effect apply the function to each element, returning a corresponding dictionary.
