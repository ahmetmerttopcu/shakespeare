\title{Structure and Tools for Text Analysis of Shakespeare's Plays}
\description{
This package contains classes and functions to support text analysis of
Shakespeare's plays.  The package is based on the XML encoding of the plays
created by Jon Bosak and available, for example, from
\url{http://www.ibiblio.org/xml/examples/shakespeare/}.
}
\details{
The package also is an example of an interface from R to Python using the XR
interface structure described in the book \emph{Extending R}.

The structure and tools occupy a middle ground between the highly recursive
format of XML and the unstructured text typically used in Python natural language
tools.  Functions and classes in the package \dQuote{flatten} the XML structure
to make analysis in R easier, while retaining structural information about acts,
scenes and speakers.
